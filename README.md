## Tasks Completed
* Dowloaded necessary NPM packages with `npm install` on the Command Line
* Created `src` and necessary folders for development
* Created a server.js file to connect back-end and front-end
* Copied over routes, utils, models, and controllers from Week 21: Activity 5.
* Created a `React-Router nav` to display different pages.
* Created a header, footer, and body using React.
* In the src:
    * created a `Search` and `Saved` component
    * In the Search component:
        * created a form that returns the input value to the component
        * the value runs in an API query search to get the first 10 books with that input
        * books are mapped into a bookList array state, which is then passed to the `Results` page
        * created a click function that `posts` the targeted book to the database collection (also passed to the Results page)
    * In the Saved Component:
        * uses an API call that `gets` all the saved book from the database to pass to the Results page
        * created a Delete button that `removes` the targeted book from the database (also passed to the Results page)
    * In the Results page, the passed in array is mapped to the `Book` page
        * depending on which button function is passed in, that function and button label will be sent to Book as well
    * In the Book page, the individual books from the passed in array are rendered
