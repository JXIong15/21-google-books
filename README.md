## Functionality
* When the user loads the page, they are shown a biography of the portfolio.
* Clicking on the `navtabs` at the top allow for page changes.
* In the `My Work` section, there are two buttons. Clicking on either button will display either `Group Projcts` or `Individual Work`.
  * Each project's image is clickable to the deployed app.
  * The title is clickable to the GitHub Repo.
* In the `Contact Page`, the contact information is clickable.
  * The `Formspree` form can be filled out to send out inquiries.


## Tasks Completed
* Dowloaded necessary NPM packages with `npm install` on the Command Line
* Created `src` and necessary folders for development
* Created a `React-Router nav bar` to display different pages.
* Created a header, footer, and body using React.
* In the work page, GitHub profile is clickable.
* Created arrays for Homework and Group Projects. Set these arrays as states in the `Body.js`. 
  * Passed this state as a ProjectList prop through `Work.js` to `Project.js`. Passed the HWList prop to the `Homework.js` file.
  * Mapped over the `ProjectList` arrays to the `IndividualProject` component, displaying all projects using the same component.
  * Since the `Individual Work` is displayed in two columns, had to create another array with each place in the array containing two of the homework assignments.
    * Mapped over this array by passing each homework pair to `IndividualHW`.
    * In `Individual Homework`, assigned each homework array to it's own constant. Pulled out needed data from each array to display in the return method as a row of two hw.
* On the contact page, links are clickable.
  * Form is created by Formspree and will send emails once submitted.
